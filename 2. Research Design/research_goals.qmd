title: "Developing Research Goals"
---

Transforming business objectives and product strategies into clear, actionable research questions and hypotheses that drive meaningful user research outcomes.

This is an early step in bridging the gap between business or program objectives and research activities. At this stage, we transform high-level organizational goals into specific, measurable research objectives and testable hypotheses. It employs a structured approach to ensure research efforts directly address business needs while maintaining focus on user-centered outcomes.

The method draws from both scientific methodology and business strategy frameworks, incorporating elements of OKR (Objectives and Key Results) planning and hypothesis-driven development. It emphasizes collaborative goal-setting that aligns stakeholder needs with research capabilities and resources.

Research Goal Development typically occurs at the beginning of the research planning process but can be revisited throughout the project life cycle as new insights emerge or business priorities shift.

Typical Activities:

-   Alignment between business objectives and research goals

-   SMART criteria application (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

-   Hypothesis-driven approach to goal formation

-   Iterative refinement process

-   Stakeholder consensus building

-   Clear success metrics definition

### Variations

-   Quick Goals - Rapid goal-setting for time-sensitive research

-   Strategic Goals - Long-term research agenda development

-   Hypothesis Mapping - Focus on assumption testing and validation

-   Impact Mapping - Goals linked directly to business metrics

### Resources Required

-   Team Composition

    -   Research lead

    -   Product stakeholders

    -   Business stakeholders

    -   Technical stakeholders (as needed)

-   Tools and Templates

    -   Goal framework template

    -   Hypothesis statement template

    -   Research question matrix

    -   Impact assessment worksheet

### When to Use

-   Starting new research initiatives

-   Quarterly research planning

-   Product strategy shifts

-   New feature development

-   Addressing identified knowledge gaps

-   Validating business assumptions

### Planning Questions To Be Answered

-   What are our critical knowledge gaps?

-   Which assumptions need validation?

-   How will research impact decision-making?

-   What metrics indicate success?
